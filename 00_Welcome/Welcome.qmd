-   Introductions

## Setting expectations 

-   Learning **R**/Bayesian inference/hierarchical models takes time and practice - so what can we do in two days?

## Format 

-   Lecture

-   Exercises

-   Discussions

## Files

- Everything is reproducible (theoretically)

## Revised agenda

-   Intro to R (up to plotting)

::: incremental
-   Exercise \# 1 (data manipulation)

-   Intro to R (plotting)

-   Exercise \# 2 (data visualization)

-   Intro to Bayesian inference/estimation
:::

## Revised agenda

-   Intro to `rstanarm` library

::: incremental
-   Intro to hierarchical models

-   Exercise \# 3 (analysis of catch-per-unit effort data)

-   Exercise \# 4 (temporal trends in fantail darter abundance)

-   If time...hierarchical growth models, left-censored data, other examples
